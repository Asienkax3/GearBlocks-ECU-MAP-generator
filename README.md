VE Map Generator
A tool for generating and editing VE maps, allowing easy value adjustments and export to a Lua file for the GearBlocks script.

Features:
✅ Create VE maps in an intuitive graphical interface
✅ Edit values by dragging the mouse or clicking individual cells
✅ Export the map to a Lua file (Save to Lua)
✅ Automatic table update when entering RPM or pressure values
✅ Ongoing development with planned new features

How to Use
1. Loading and Updating Data
📌 Each time you launch the application, you must click the “Upgrade Grid” button to correctly load data before saving!

2. Editing Map Values
🔹 To change values in the table, hold the left mouse button and drag across the tiles.
🔹 Alternatively, right-click, drag the mouse, then release the button – selected cells will be ready for editing.

3. Automatic Updates
✏️ Entering a value in the RPM or Pressure field and pressing Enter automatically updates the table.

4. Saving to Lua File
💾 After editing the map, click “Save to Lua” to export the generated data to a file.
📂 Then, copy the VE_Table content into the maps.lua file inside the GearBlocks script directory.

Future Development
🚀 The application is constantly evolving, and I plan to add more features to make working with VE maps even easier.
